# Pots, fyi

Pots, fyi will be a music streaming app
intended to run on a personal server.

## Current status

If you put tracks under the `static/music` subdirectory
(`music` can be a symlink),
and you type the exact full path of a track,
you can play it in a browser
that supports HTML5 `<audio>`.

Pots, fyi depends on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org),
the Python web microframework.
